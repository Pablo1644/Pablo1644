### 🔭 About me

I am currently developing my **data analysis skills**.  
I am currently  member of the **DataHeroes** program, where I continuously learn things for data analysis through **practical homework and small projects**. 
I was learning Excel, mainly focused on the pivots and SQL. 

My next step  in this course is learning **Power BI**. Before that, I will complete **two smaller Udemy courses** to consolidate my Excel and SQL skills.
I graduated from the physics department, where I dealt with experimental data processing both in my thesis and during my studies. </br>
As an **engineer working in the Laboratory of Fire Alarm Systems and Fire Automation – BA**, I work with a wide range of experimental results and technical data and I am trying to implement automatization in my work where it is possible.

### 📈 Practical use of data analysis

Developing my data analysis skills has allowed me to **automate and improve my work**:

- **Excel**  
  Conditional formatting allows me to quickly identify maximum and minimum values when testing optical functionality in accordance with the **PN-EN 54-23:2010** standard. I am currently using it in my job.

- **Python automation**  
  A Python script generates a monthly pressure recording table, taking public holidays into account. The script also includes automated tests. It is currently used in my job.

- **Experimental data analysis**  
  Analysis of experimental transmission data allowed me to determine the energy gap of a given semiconductor. The analysis was performed using **Python**, primarily with the **pandas** and **matplotlib** libraries.

- **Professional experience**  
  I performed data analysis using Python during my engineering work and during my internship at the **National Centre for Nuclear Research**.

- **Master’s thesis**  
  In my master’s thesis, I analyzed images and simulations of computer-generated holograms using **Python**. Python was also a tool for realisation spatial fragmentation for creating Ronchi gratings and for "saving" 4 pictures in one image.
